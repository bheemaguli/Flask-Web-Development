    ">Note how in this view function, request is used as if it were a global variable. In reality, request cannot be a global variable; in a multithreaded server several threads can be working on different requests from different clients all at the same time, so each thread needs to see a different object in request. Contexts enable Flask to make certain variables globally accessible to a thread without interfering with the other threads.\n",
