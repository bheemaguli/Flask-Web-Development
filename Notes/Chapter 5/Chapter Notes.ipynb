    "> Tables have a special column called the primary key, which holds a unique identifier for each row stored in the table. Tables can also have columns called foreign keys, which reference the primary key of a row in the same or another table. These links between rows are called relationships and are the foundation of the relational database model.\n",

    "> Databases that do not follow the relational model described in the previous section are collectively referred to as NoSQL databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "> One common organization for NoSQL databases uses collections instead of tables and documents instead of records. NoSQL databases are designed in a way that makes joins difficult, so most of them do not support this operation at all. \n",

    "# 5.3 SQL or NoSQL?\n",
    "> SQL databases excel at storing structured data in an efficient and compact form. These databases go to great lengths to preserve consistency, even in the face of power failures or hardware malfunctions. The paradigm that allows relational databases to reach this high level of reliability is called ACID, which stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. NoSQL databases relax some of the ACID requirements and as a result can sometimes get a performance edge.\n",

    "\n",
    "> As you make progress developing an application, you will find that your database models need to change, and when that happens the database needs to be updated as well. Flask-SQLAlchemy creates database tables from models only when they do not exist already, so the only way to make it update tables is by destroying the old tables first—but of course, this causes all the data in the database to be lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A better solution is to use a database migration framework. In the same way source code version control tools keep track of changes to source code files, a database migration framework keeps track of changes to a database schema, allowing incremental changes to be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The developer of SQLAlchemy has written a migration framework called Alembic, but instead of using Alembic directly, Flask applications can use the Flask-Migrate extension, a lightweight Alembic wrapper that integrates it with the flask command.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5.10.1 Creating a Migration Repository\n",

    "from flask_migrate import Migrate\n",
    "...\n",

    "### 5.10.2 Creating a Migration Script\n",

    "> Alembic migrations can be created manually or automatically using the **revision** and **migrate** commands, respectively. A manual migration creates a migration skeleton script with empty `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions that need to be implemented by the developer using directives exposed by Alembic’s `Operations` object. An automatic migration attempts to generate the code for the `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions by looking for differences between the model definitions and the current state of the database.\n",

For example, if a column is renamed, an automatically generated migration may show that the column in question was deleted and a new column was added with the new name. Leaving the migration as is will cause the data in this column to be lost! For this reason, migration scripts generated automatically should always be reviewed and manually corrected if they have any inaccuracies.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> To make changes to your database schema with Flask-Migrate, the following procedure needs to be followed: \n",
    "> 1. Make the necessary changes to the model classes.\n",
    "> 2. Create an automatic migration script with the `flask db migrate` command.\n",
    "> 3. Review the generated script and adjust it so that it accurately represents the changes that were made to the models.\n",
    "> 4. Add the migration script to source control.\n",
    "> 5. Apply the migration to the database with the `flask db` upgrade command.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.10.3 Upgrading the Database\n",
    "Use `flask db upgrade` to update the migration. If this is the first time of use, where there is no database, this will act as `db.create_all()`\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.10.4 Adding More Migrations\n",
    "> The procedure to introduce a change in the database is similar to what was done to introduce the first migration:\n",
    ">  1. Make the necessary changes in the database models.\n",
    ">  2. Generate a migration with the flask db migrate command.\n",
